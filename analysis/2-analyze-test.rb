It was a major battle of the [[Wars of the Roses]]. The opposing forces were an army led by nobles loyal to the captive King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] of the [[House of Lancaster]] and his Queen [[Margaret of Anjou]] on one side, and the army of [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]], the rival claimant to the throne, on the other.\n\nFor several years before the battle, the Duke of York had become increasingly opposed to the weak King Henry's court. After Henry became his prisoner, he laid claim to the throne, but lacked sufficient support. Instead, in an agreement known as the [[Act of Accord]], he was made Henry's heir to the throne, displacing from the succession Henry's and Margaret's 7-year-old son [[Edward of Westminster|Edward, Prince of Wales]]. Margaret of Anjou and several prominent nobles were irreconcilably opposed to this accord, and massed their armies in the north. Richard of York marched north to deal with them, but found he was outnumbered.\n\nAlthough he occupied [[Sandal Castle]], York sortied from the castle on 30 December. His reasons for doing so have been variously ascribed to deception by the Lancastrian armies, or treachery by some nobles and Lancastrian officers who York thought were his allies, or simple rashness or miscalculation by York. The Duke of York was killed and his army was destroyed, many of the prominent Yorkist leaders and their family members died in the battle or were captured and executed.\n\n==Background==\nKing Henry VI ascended the throne in 1422, when he was only nine months old. He grew up to be an ineffective king, and prone to spells of mental illness. There were increasingly bitter divisions among the officials and councillors who governed in Henry's name, mainly over the conduct of the [[Hundred Years' War]] with France. By the early 1450s, the most important rivalry was that between [[Richard, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]], and [[Edmund Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset]]. York argued for a more vigorous prosecution of the war, to recover territories recently lost to the French,<ref>Clark (2016), p. 45</ref> while Somerset belonged to the party which tried to secure peace by making concessions.<ref>Rowse, pp. 111, 112</ref> York had been Lieutenant in France for several years and resented being supplanted in that office by Somerset, who had then failed to defend [[Normandy]] against French armies.<ref>Rowse, pp. 112, 119</ref>\n\nYork was not only the wealthiest magnate in the land,<ref>Rowse, p. 109</ref> but was also descended through both his parents from  [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]], leading to calls that he be recognised as successor to the childless King Henry.<ref>Seward, p. 35</ref> His rival, Somerset, belonged to the [[House of Beaufort|Beaufort family]], who were distant cousins of King Henry. Originally illegitimate, the Beauforts had been made legitimate by an Act of Parliament but were supposedly barred from the line of succession to the throne.<ref>Goodwin (2012), p. 76</ref> However, there was always the possibility that this could be circumvented and the Beaufort line eventually produced King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] and the [[Tudor dynasty]].\n\nYork was appointed [[Chief governor of Ireland|Lieutenant of Ireland]], effectively exiling him from court, while Somerset increased his influence over the King. In 1452, York marched on London in an attempt to force Henry to dismiss Somerset from the government, but at this stage he lacked support and was forced to swear not to take arms against the King at [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]].<ref>Seward, p. 38</ref> Then in 1453, Henry VI suffered a complete mental breakdown. The [[Magnum Concilium|Great Council]] of peers appointed York [[Lord Protector]] and he governed the country responsibly, but Henry recovered his sanity after eighteen months and restored Somerset to favour. During Henry's madness his Queen, [[Margaret of Anjou]], had given birth to a son, which dashed York's hopes of becoming king if Henry died.<ref>Weir (2015), p.177</ref>\n\nFearing arrest for treason, York and his most prominent allies, the Nevilles (York's brother in law, the [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Earl of Salisbury]] and his son, the [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]], later known as the \"Kingmaker\"), finally resorted to armed force in 1455. At the [[First Battle of St Albans]], many of York's and Salisbury's rivals and enemies were killed, including Somerset, the [[Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]] (whose family, the Percys, had been involved in a [[Percy-Neville feud|long-running feud]] with the Nevilles) and [[Thomas Clifford, 8th Baron de Clifford|Lord Clifford]].<ref>Rowse, p. 136</ref>\n\nAfter the battle, York reaffirmed his loyalty to King Henry, who had been found abandoned in a shop in the town. He was reappointed Lord Protector and Lieutenant of Ireland. Margaret of Anjou nevertheless suspected York of wishing to supplant her infant son, Edward, as Henry's successor, and the heirs of the Lancastrian nobles who were killed at St Albans remained at deadly [[feud]] with York.<ref name=Rose143>Rowse, p. 143</ref>\n\n==Events of the year preceding Wakefield==\nAfter an uneasy peace during which attempts at reconciliation failed, hostilities broke out again in 1459. Richard of York once again feared indictment for rebellion by a Great Council dominated by his opponents.<ref>Goodwin (2012), p. 116</ref> He and the Nevilles concentrated their forces near York's stronghold at [[Ludlow Castle]] in the [[Welsh Marches]] but at the confrontation with the royal army which became known as the [[Battle of Ludford]], some of Warwick's contingent from the garrison of [[Calais]], led by experienced captain [[Andrew Trollope]], defected overnight. York and the Nevilles promptly abandoned their troops and fled. The next day, the outnumbered and leaderless Yorkist army surrendered.<ref>Weir (2015), p. 230</ref>\n\nYork went to Ireland, where he had unchallenged support, while Salisbury, Warwick and York's eldest son [[Edward IV of England|Edward, Earl of March]] made their way to Calais, where Warwick was [[Constable of Calais|Constable]]. They narrowly forestalled the new [[Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]] who, with Trollope, had been sent to regain it.<ref>Weir, pp. 232–233</ref> Lancastrian attempts to reassert their authority over Ireland and Calais failed, but York and his supporters were declared traitors and [[attainder|attainted]]. The victorious Lancastrians became reviled for the manner in which their army had looted the town of Ludlow after the Yorkist surrender at Ludford Bridge, and the repressive acts of a compliant [[Parliament of Devils]] which caused many uncommitted peers to fear for their own property and titles.<ref>Seward, pp. 71–72</ref> The country remained in disorder.\n\nIn 1460, the Nevilles invaded England through a foothold they had already established at [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]] and rapidly secured London and the South of England where Warwick had popular support. They then advanced north to engage Henry's army in the Midlands. At the [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Battle of Northampton]], part of the Lancastrian army defected and the rest were decisively defeated.<ref>Hicks, Michael. ''The Wars of the Roses'', (Yale University Press, 2010), 153.</ref> Henry was captured on the battlefield for the second time. He was taken to London, and confined in the [[Bishop of London]]'s palace.<ref>Rowse, p. 141</ref> [[George Neville (bishop)|George Neville]], Bishop of Exeter, was appointed Chancellor of England and [[Henry Bourchier, 1st Earl of Essex|Viscount Bourchier]] (York's brother in law) was appointed Treasurer.<ref>Ross, Charles. ''Edward IV'', (University of California Press, 1974), p. 27</ref>\n\nThe Duke of York landed in [[Chester]] some weeks later and made his way to London with much pomp. Entering [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], he attempted to claim the throne, but was met with stunned silence. Even his close allies were not prepared to support such a drastic step.<ref>Seward, p. 82</ref> Instead, after the [[House of Lords]] had considered his claim, they passed the [[Act of Accord]], by which Henry would remain king, but York would govern the country as Lord Protector. Henry's son was disinherited, and York or his heirs would become king on Henry's death.<ref>Rowse, p. 142</ref> The powerless and frightened Henry was forced to assent.\n\n===Lancastrian moves===\nWhen the Battle of Northampton was fought, Queen Margaret and her seven-year-old son Edward had been at [[Eccleshall Castle]] near [[Coventry]]. After many adventures with brigands and outlaws<ref name=Rowse143>Rowse, p.143</ref> they fled via [[Cheshire]] to [[Harlech Castle]] in North Wales, where they joined Lancastrian nobles (including Henry's half-brother [[Jasper Tudor]] and the [[Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter|Duke of Exeter]]) who were recruiting armies in Wales and the [[West Country]]. They later proceeded by ship to [[Scotland]], where Margaret gained troops and other aid for the Lancastrian cause from the Queen and Regent, [[Mary of Guelders]], in return for the surrender of the town and castle of [[Berwick upon Tweed]].<ref name=Rowse144>Rowse, p. 144</ref>\n\nAt the same time, other Lancastrians were rallying in [[Northern England]]. Many of them, including the [[Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]] and Lords [[John Clifford, 9th Baron de Clifford|Clifford]] and [[Thomas de Ros, 9th Baron de Ros|Ros]], had estates and influence in the north. They were later joined by the [[Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]]{{#tag:ref|Somerset had been besieging Calais, but was outwardly reconciled to Warwick on 8 August 1460 and allowed to return to England<ref>Clark (2016), p. 224</ref>|group=nb}} and the [[Thomas Courtenay, 14th Earl of Devon|Earl of Devon]], who brought their forces from the West Country.<ref name=Rowse143/> Northumberland, Clifford and Somerset were the sons of York's and Salisbury's rivals who had been killed at St. Albans. The Lancastrian forces mustered near [[Kingston upon Hull]], and were said (in ''Gregory's Chronicle'', a near-contemporary account) to number 15,000. A substantial part of these forces encamped at [[Pontefract]] began pillaging York's and Salisbury's estates nearby.<ref name=Rowse143/>\n\n===York's response===\nFaced with these challenges to his authority as Protector, York despatched his eldest son Edward to the Welsh Marches to contain the Lancastrians in Wales and left the Earl of Warwick in charge in London. He himself marched to the north of England on 9 December, accompanied by his second son [[Edmund, Earl of Rutland]], and the Earl of Salisbury. He tried to bring a train of artillery under \"one called Lovelace, a gentleman of Kent\"<ref>Clark (2016), p. 229</ref> but bad weather forced the artillery to return to London.\n\nYork's and Salisbury's army was said by some to number 8,000 to 9,000 men, but by others to be only a few hundred strong, as York intended to recruit local forces with a [[Commission of Array]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.richardiii.net/downloads/Ricardian/essay_wakefield.pdf| format=PDF| title=Richard III.net| accessdate=30 June 2009|author=Dockray, Keith| page=8}}</ref> He had probably underestimated both the numbers of the Lancastrian army in the north and the degree of opposition he had provoked by his attempt to seize the throne. On an earlier expedition to the north during his first protectorship in 1454, he and the Nevilles had easily subdued a rebellion by the Percys and the Duke of Exeter.<ref>Clark (2016), pp.120-125</ref> In 1460, not only had almost every other northern peer joined the Lancastian army, but York's nominal supporters were also divided. The Nevilles were one of the wealthiest and most influential families in the North and in addition to controlling large estates, the Earl of Salisbury had held the office of [[Lord Warden of the Marches#Warden of the Eastern March|Warden of the Eastern March]] for several years. However, in the [[Neville-Neville feud]], the cadet branch of the family headed by Salisbury had largely disinherited and eclipsed the senior branch under his great nephew, the [[Ralph Neville, 2nd Earl of Westmorland|Earl of Westmoreland]]. Westmoreland had spent several years trying to recover his lands.<ref>Clark (2016), p. 50</ref> He had since become too ill, perhaps with some mental disorder, to play any active part. His younger brother, [[John Neville, Baron Neville|John Neville of Raby]], had much to gain by York's and Salisbury's destruction.<ref name=Goodwin145>Goodwin (2012), pp. 145-146</ref>\n\nThe Lancastrians were still being reinforced. On 16 December, at the [[Battle of Worksop]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], York's vanguard clashed with Somerset's contingent from the West Country moving north to join the Lancastrian army, and was defeated.<ref name=Warner49>Warner, p. 49</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:SandalCastleMotte.jpg|right|thumb|The remains of the [[motte-and-bailey|motte]] of Sandal Castle]]\nOn 21 December, York reached his own fortress of [[Sandal Castle]] near Wakefield. He sent probes towards the Lancastrian camp at Pontefract {{convert|9|mi|km}} to the east, but these were repulsed. York sent for help to his son Edward, but before any reinforcements could arrive, he sortied from the castle on 30 December.<ref>Weir (2015), p. 253</ref>\n\nIt is not known for certain why York did so. One theory was later recounted in ''[[Edward Hall]]'s chronicle'', written a few decades after the event, but partly from first-hand sources, and the contemporary [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] ''[[Jean de Waurin]]'s'' chronicle. In a stratagem possibly devised by the veteran Andrew Trollope (who by Waurin's account had also sent messages to York via feigned deserters that he was prepared to change sides once again)<ref>Seward (2007), p. 83</ref> half the Lancastrian army under Somerset and Clifford advanced openly towards Sandal Castle, over the open space known as \"Wakefield Green\" between the castle and the [[River Calder, West Yorkshire|River Calder]], while the remainder under Ros and the [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|Earl of Wiltshire]] were concealed in the woods surrounding the area.<ref name=Dockray10>{{cite web| url=http://www.richardiii.net/downloads/Ricardian/essay_wakefield.pdf| format=PDF| title=Richard III.net| accessdate=30 June 2009| author=Dockray, Keith| pages=9–10}}</ref> York was probably short of provisions in the castle and seeing that the enemy were apparently no stronger than his own army, seized the opportunity to engage them in the open rather than withstand a siege while waiting for reinforcements.<ref name=Warner50>Warner, p. 50</ref>{{#tag:ref|However, Wiltshire was almost certainly not present. He had fled to the continent shortly before the Nevilles landed at Sandwich<ref>Clark (2016), p. 217</ref> and landed in South Wales with a force of Breton, French and Irish mercenaries in the early weeks of 1461.<ref>Clark (2016), p. 234</ref>|group=nb}}\n\nOther accounts suggested that, possibly in addition to Trollope's deception, York was fooled by some of John Neville of Raby's forces displaying false colours into thinking that reinforcements sent by Warwick had arrived. By another contemporary account, [[William Worcester]]'s ''Annales Rerum Anglicorum'', John Neville himself obtained a Commission of Array from Richard of York to raise 8,000 men to fight on York's side under the Earl of Westmoreland.<ref name=Goodwin145/> Having gathered this force and enticed York to leave the castle to rendezvous with him, John Neville then defected to the Lancastrians.<ref name=Dockray10/>\n\nAnother suggestion was that York and Somerset had agreed a truce during Christmas until 6 January, the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Feast of Epiphany]], but the Lancastrians had no intention of honouring the truce. On three successive days, they sent heralds to provoke York into premature action with insulting messages<ref>Weir (1995), p. 255</ref> and when York moved into the open the Lancastrians treacherously attacked earlier than had been agreed, catching York at a disadvantage while many of his men were absent foraging for supplies.<ref>Ross, Charles. ''Edward IV'', (University of California Press, 1974), p. 30</ref>\n\nThe simplest suggestion was that York acted rashly.<ref name=Rowse143/> For example, historian [[John Sadler (historian)|John Sadler]] states that there was no Lancastrian deception or ambush; York led his men from the castle on a foraging expedition (or by popular belief, to rescue some of his foragers who were under attack)<ref>Clark (2016), p. 230</ref> and as successive Lancastrian contingents joined the battle (the last being Clifford's division, encamped south and east of Sandal Magna), York's army was outnumbered, surrounded and overwhelmed.<ref name=Sadler60>Sadler (2011), p. 60</ref>\n\nThe Yorkists marched out of Sandal Castle down the present-day Manygates Lane towards the Lancastrians located to the north of the castle. It is generally accepted that, as York engaged the Lancastrians to his front, others attacked him from the flank and rear, cutting him off from the castle. In Edward Hall's words:\n\n<blockquote>...&nbsp;but when he was in the plain ground between his castle and the town of Wakefield, he was environed on every side, like a fish in a net, or a deer in a buckstall; so that he manfully fighting was within half an hour slain and dead, and his whole army discomfited.<ref name=Dockray12>{{cite web| url=http://www.richardiii.net/downloads/Ricardian/essay_wakefield.pdf| format=PDF| title=Richard III.net| accessdate=30 June 2009| author=Dockray, Keith| page=12}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Casualties===\nOne near-contemporary source (''Gregory's Chronicle'') claimed that 2,500 Yorkists and 200 Lancastrians were killed, but other sources give wildly differing figures, from 2,200 to only 700 Yorkist dead.\n\nThe Duke of York was either killed in the battle or captured and immediately executed. Some later works support the folklore that he suffered a crippling wound to the knee and was unhorsed, and he and his closest followers then fought to the death at that spot;<ref name=Sadler60/> others relate the account that he was taken prisoner (by one Sir James Luttrell of Devonshire), mocked by his captors and beheaded.<ref>{{cite book| last=Jones| first=Dan| title=The Hollow Crown: The Wars of the Roses and the Rise of the Tudors| publisher=Faber & Faber| year=2014| isbn=9780571288090| page=187}}</ref>\n\nHis son [[Edmund, Earl of Rutland]] attempted to escape over Wakefield Bridge, but was overtaken and killed, possibly by Clifford in revenge for his father's death at St Albans. Salisbury's second son [[Thomas Neville (died 1460)|Sir Thomas Neville]] also died in the battle.<ref name=Rowse144/> Salisbury's son in law [[William Bonville, 6th Baron Harington|William, Lord Harington]] and Harington's father, William Bonville, were captured and executed immediately after the battle. (The Bonvilles had been engaged in a [[Bonville–Courtenay feud|feud]] with the Earl of Devon and the Courtenay family in Devon and Cornwall.) Salisbury himself escaped the battlefield but was captured during the night, and was taken to the Lancastrian camp. Although the Lancastrian nobles might have been prepared to allow Salisbury to ransom himself, he was dragged out of Pontefract Castle and beheaded by local commoners, to whom he had been a harsh overlord.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.richardiii.net/downloads/Ricardian/essay_wakefield.pdf| format=PDF| title=Richard III.net| accessdate=30 June 2009| author=Dockray, Keith| page=14}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Richard of York Memorial Inscription - geograph.org.uk - 858006.jpg|right|thumb|Monument to Richard of York]]\nAfter the battle the heads of York, Rutland and Salisbury were displayed over [[York city walls#Micklegate Bar|Micklegate Bar]], the south-western gate through the [[York city walls]], the Duke wearing a paper crown and a sign saying \"Let York overlook the town of York\".<ref>Weir (2015), p.257</ref>\n\nThe death of Richard of York did not end the wars, or the [[House of York]]'s claim to the throne. The northern Lancastrian army which had been victorious at Wakefield was reinforced by Scots and borderers eager for plunder, and marched south. They defeated Warwick's army at the [[Second Battle of St Albans]] and recaptured the feeble-minded King Henry, who had been abandoned on the battlefield for the third time, but were refused entry to London<ref>Charles Ross, ''Edward IV'', (University of California Press, 1974), 32.</ref> and failed to occupy the city. Warwick and Edward of March reoccupied London, and within a few weeks, Edward of March was proclaimed King Edward IV.\n\nAt the first Battle of St Albans, York had been content with the death of his rivals for power. At Wakefield and in every battle in the Wars of the Roses thereafter, the victors would eliminate not only any opposing leaders but also their family members and supporters, making the struggle more bitter and revenge driven.<ref>{{cite book| last=Hicks| first=Michael| title=The Wars of the Roses| publisher=Yale University Press| year=2012| page=160}}</ref>\n\nA monument erected on the spot where the Duke of York is supposed to have perished is positioned slightly south of the more likely spot where an older monument once stood, but which was destroyed during the [[English Civil War]]. A cross in memory of York's son, Rutland, was erected at the Park Street end of Kirkgate in Wakefield.<ref>Weir (2015), p. 256</ref> Archaeologist Rachel Askew suggests that the memorial cross to the Duke of York may be fictional as the late 16th and early 17th century antiquarian John Camden did not mention it in his description of the location.<ref>Askew (2016), p. 54</ref>\n\n==In literature and folklore==\nMany people are familiar with [[William Shakespeare]]'s melodramatic version of events in ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]'', notably the murder of Edmund of Rutland, although Edmund is depicted as a small child, and following his unnecessary slaughter by Clifford, Margaret torments his father, York, before murdering him also. In fact, Rutland, at seventeen, was more than old enough to be an active participant in the fighting. Margaret was almost certainly still in Scotland at the time.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.susanhigginbotham.com/blog/posts/the-death-of-edmund-earl-of-rutland/ | title=The Death of Edmund, Earl of Rutland | date=17 February 2010 | first=Susan | last=Higginbotham | authorlink=Susan Higginbotham | accessdate=28 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe battle is said by some to be the source for the mnemonic for remembering the traditional colours of the [[rainbow]], [[ROYGBIV|Richard of York Gave Battle in Vain]],<ref name=\"Surdhar2013\">{{cite book|last=Surdhar|first=Christina|title=Bloody British History: York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BxATDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT56|accessdate=29 December 2017|date=2 September 2013|publisher=History Press|isbn=9780750951593|page=56}}</ref> and also the mocking [[nursery rhyme]], \"[[The Grand Old Duke of York]]\",<ref>J.

The expression is usually used to warn against risky action, as in \"If you do that you'll end up in Dicky's Meadow.\" However, the first known usage of that phrase did not appear until the 1860s, around 400 years after the battle took place.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://wordhistories.net/2016/06/22/origin-of-dickys-meadow/ | title=Origin of the Lancashire phrase ‘in Dicky’s meadow’ | first=Pascal | last=Tréguer |date=22 June 2016 | publisher=Word Histories | accessdate=28 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Footnotes==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n;Citations\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|indent=y}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Askew |date=22 February 2016 |first=Rachel |title=Biography and Memory: Sandal Castle and the English Civil War |journal=[[European Journal of Archaeology]] |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=48–67 |doi=10.1179/1461957115Y.0000000012 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Churchill|first=Winston|authorlink=Winston Churchill|title=A History of the English-speaking Peoples |volume=I |publisher=Cassell |location=London|year=1956|isbn=0-304-29500-0}}\n* {{cite book |last=Clark |date=7 September 2016 |first=Karen L. |title=The Nevills of Middleham: England's Most Powerful Family in the Wars of the Roses |publisher=The History Press |place=[[Stroud]] |isbn=978-0-7509-6365-7 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Goodwin |date=16 February 2012 |first=George |title=Fatal Colours: Towton 1461...

The first attack, a [[car bomb]]ing, took place outside Kay's Tavern, a pub along Crowe street in [[Dundalk]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]] close to the border. The second, a gun and bomb attack, took place at Donnelly's Bar & Filling Station in [[Silverbridge, County Armagh]], just across the border inside [[Northern Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&day=19&month=12&year=1975|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|first=Malcolm|last=Sutton|date=|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|access-date=15 October 2017}}</ref> The attack has been linked to the [[Glenanne gang]], a group of [[Ulster loyalism|Loyalist militants]] who were either members of the UVF, the [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] (UDR), the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) and the closely linked UVF paramilitary the [[Red Hand Commando]] (RHC), some of the Glenanne gang were members of two of these organizations at the same time like gang leaders [[Billy Hanna]] who was in both the UVF and the UDR and who fought for the [[British Army]] during the [[Korean War]] and [[John Weir (loyalist)]] who was in the UVF and was a sergeant in the RUC.<ref>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/collusion/docs/cassel061106.pdf The Cassel Report (2006), cain.ulst.ac.uk; retrieved 28 September 2013.]</ref> At least 25 UDR men and police officers were named as members of the gang.<ref>Lethal Allies: British Collusion in Ireland - Conclusions, PatFinucaneCentre.org; accessed 7 May 2015.</ref> The [[Red Hand Commando]] claimed to have carried out both attacks.<ref>https://talkofdatown.wordpress.com/tag/crowes-nest/</ref>\n\n==Attacks==\nAccording to journalist Joe Tiernan, the attacks were planned and led by [[Robert McConnell (loyalist)|Robert McConnell]] and [[Robin Jackson|Robin \"The Jackal\" Jackson]] who were both alleged to have carried out dozens of sectarian murders during [[The Troubles]] mainly from 1974 to 1977 mostly in south Armagh which in 1975 was virtually lawless and Loyalist paramilitaries and the [[Provisional IRA]] roamed the streets and countryside and could set up bogus military checkpoints freely.<ref>Harnden, Toby (1999). Bandit Country. - \"After Dean was killed, some Army commanders concluded that it was not worth risking the lives of soldiers to prevent an IRA roadblock being set up.\" page 172</ref>\n\nThe attack was planned at the Glenanne farm of RUC reserve officer James Mitchell which was where most [[terrorist]] acts were planned by the gang and the farm also acted as a UVF arms dump and bomb-making site. After the attacks were finished everyone involved in both attacks was to meet at Mitchell's farm. Then if there was any heat Mitchell could claim the bombers and shooters were with him when the attacks happened.<ref>The Barron Report (2003), pp. 144–145.</ref>\n\nThe first phase of the terrorist plan started at around 18:15 along Crowe Street in Dundalk when a 100-pound no-warning bomb exploded in a [[Ford]] Sports car just outside Kay's Tavern. The blast killed Hugh Waters who was a tailor and had just dropped into the pub to deliver some clothes he had altered for the pub's owner almost instantly. Jack Rooney who was walking past the town hall on the opposite side of the street was struck in the head by flying shrapnel and died three days later. A further 20 people were injured in the explosion, several of them very seriously. The car bomb was fitted with fake southern registration plates and placed in one of the busiest streets in Dundalk in the hope of causing maximum death and injury. According to Joe Tiernan, UVF commander Robin Jackson planted the bomb and along with other members of his unit escaped across the border in a blue [[Hillman Hunter]] around the time the bomb went off. <ref>Joe Tiernan: The Dublin and Monaghan Bombings And The Murder Triangle (2006) pp.226. </ref>\n\nAt around 21:00, about three hours after the Dundalk bombing, the second phase of the coordinated terrorist plan which was led by McConnell took place at Donnelly's Bar & Filling Station in the small Armagh village Silverbridge close to [[Crossmaglen]].\nAs the unit arrived in two cars came unusually fast towards the pub, the publican's teenage son Michael Donnelly (14) who was serving petrol to a customer noticing the strange speed of the cars ran towards the pub to warn people, but before he could make it inside McConnell jumped out of one of the cars and shot the teenage boy dead with a [[Sten gun]]. McConnell then shot the man Michael Donnelly had been serving petrol to in the head, although the man survived the shooting he was maimed for life. Then a second gunman, believed to be [[Billy McCaughey]],  a UVF volunteer and member of the [[Special Patrol Group (RUC)|RUC Special Patrol Group]], shot dead a second person, local man Patrick Donnelly (no relation to the pub owner's family) who had been waiting for petrol. McConnell then went inside the pub and sprayed the bar with his Sten SMG, killing a third man, Trevor Bracknell, and seriously injuring three more people. As McConnell withdrew to his car, two other members of the unit carried a 25-pound cylinder bomb inside the pub. As McConnell's unit fled back to Mitchell's farm, the bomb detonated inside the pub, however by this time most of the people had already left. The explosion at Kay's Tavern destroyed about 80% of the building, started a huge fire and injured two more people; with one of the injured men losing a foot and a hand in the explosion.\nNobody has ever been charged for these crimes.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{The Troubles|state=collapsed}}\n{{Ulster Volunteer Force}}\n\n[[Category:British military scandals]]\n[[Category:Mass murder in 1975]]\n[[Category:The Troubles in County Down]]\n[[Category:Ulster Volunteer Force actions]]\n[[Category:Ulster Defence Regiment]]\n[[Category:People killed by security forces during The Troubles (Northern Ireland)]]\n[[Category:Improvised explosive device bombings in Northern Ireland]]\n[[Category:Deaths by firearm in Northern Ireland]]\n[[Category:1975 in Northern Ireland]]\n[[Category:Massacres in Northern Ireland]]\n[[Category:False flag operations]]\n[[Category:Military scandals]]\n[[Category:Terrorism in Northern Ireland]]\n[[Category:20th century in County Down]]\n[[Category:July 1975 events]]"

Colonists who supported the British and opposed the Revolution are referred to as \"Loyalists\" or \"Tories\". The geographical area of the thirteen colonies is often referred to simply as \"America\".|group=N}}\n\nAfter 1765, growing [[American Revolution#Origin|philosophical and political differences]] strained the relationship between Great Britain and its colonies. [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] protests against [[No taxation without representation|taxation without representation]] followed the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] and escalated into boycotts, which culminated in 1773 with the [[Sons of Liberty]] [[Boston Tea Party|destroying a shipment of tea]] in Boston Harbor. Britain responded by closing Boston Harbor and passing a series of [[Intolerable Acts|punitive measures]] against [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. Massachusetts colonists responded with the [[Suffolk Resolves]], and they established a shadow government which wrested control of the countryside from the Crown. Twelve colonies formed a [[Continental Congress]] to coordinate their resistance, establishing committees and conventions that effectively seized power.<ref>The colony of Georgia joined later.</ref>\n\nBritish attempts to disarm the Massachusetts militia in [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|led to open combat]] on April 19, 1775. Militia forces then [[Siege of Boston|besieged Boston]], forcing a British evacuation in March 1776, and Congress appointed [[George Washington]] to command the [[Continental Army]]. Concurrently, the Americans [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|failed decisively]] in an attempt to [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|invade Quebec]] and raise insurrection against the British. On July 2, 1776, the [[Second Continental Congress]] voted for independence, issuing its [[United States Declaration of Independence|declaration]] on July&nbsp;4. [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|Sir William Howe]] launched a [[New York and New Jersey campaign|British counter-offensive]], capturing New York City and leaving American morale at a low ebb. However, victories at [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]] and [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]] restored American confidence. In 1777, the British launched an [[Saratoga Campaign|invasion from Quebec]] under [[John Burgoyne]], intending to isolate the [[New England Colonies]]. Instead of assisting this effort, Howe took his army on a separate [[Philadelphia campaign|campaign]] against Philadelphia, and Burgoyne was decisively defeated at [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] in October 1777.\n\nBurgoyne's defeat had drastic consequences. France formally [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|allied with the Americans]] and entered the war in 1778, and Spain joined the war the following year as an [[Pacte de Famille|ally of France]] but not as an ally of the United States. In 1780, the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] [[Second Anglo-Mysore War|attacked the British in India]], and tensions between Great Britain and the Netherlands erupted into [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War|open war]]. In North America, the British mounted a \"[[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War|Southern strategy]]\" led by [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]] which hinged upon a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] uprising, but too few came forward. Cornwallis suffered reversals at [[Battle of Kings Mountain|King's Mountain]] and [[Battle of Cowpens|Cowpens]]. He retreated to Yorktown, Virginia, intending an evacuation, but a decisive [[Battle of the Chesapeake|French naval victory]] deprived him of an escape. A Franco-American army led by the [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Comte de Rochambeau]] and Washington then [[Siege of Yorktown|besieged Cornwallis' army]] and, with no sign of relief, he surrendered in October 1781.\n\n[[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] in Britain had long opposed the pro-war Tories in Parliament, and the surrender gave them the upper hand. In early 1782, Parliament voted to end all offensive operations in America, but the war continued overseas. Britain remained [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|under siege in Gibraltar]] but scored a [[Battle of the Saintes|major victory]] over the French navy. On September 3, 1783, the belligerent parties signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in which Great Britain agreed to recognize the sovereignty of the United States and formally end the war. French involvement had proven decisive,<ref name=\"RichardBrooks\">Brooks, Richard (editor). ''Atlas of World Military History''. HarperCollins, 2000, p. 101 \"Washington's success in keeping the army together deprived the British of victory, but French intervention won the war.\"</ref> but France made few gains and incurred crippling debts.

In India, the war against Mysore and its allies [[Treaty of Mangalore|concluded in 1784]] without any territorial changes.\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|American Revolution}}\n\n=== Taxation disputes === \nParliament passed the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] in 1765 to pay for British military troops stationed in the American colonies after the [[French and Indian War]]. Parliament had previously passed legislation to regulate trade, but the Stamp Act introduced a new principle of a direct internal tax. Americans began to question the extent of the British Parliament's power in America, and the colonial legislatures argued that they had exclusive right to impose taxes within their jurisdictions.<ref>Colin Bonwick, The American Revolution, 1991, pp. 71-72  {{ISBN|0-8139-1346-2}}</ref> Colonists condemned the tax because their [[Rights of Englishmen|rights as Englishmen]] protected them from being taxed by a Parliament in which they had [[no taxation without representation|no elected representatives]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Gladney, Henry M. |title=No Taxation without Representation: 1768 Petition, Memorial, and Remonstrance |year=2014 |url=http://www.hgladney.com/PMR/No_Taxation_without_Representation_(book_description).pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513135503/http://www.hgladney.com/PMR/No_Taxation_without_Representation_%28book_description%29.pdf |archive-date=May 13, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> Parliament argued that the colonies were \"[[Virtual representation|represented virtually]]\", an idea that was criticized throughout the Empire.<ref name=\"google1\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YKYOAAAAQAAJ|title=Liberty and Property: Political Ideology in Eighteenth-century Britain – H.T.

The seizure of the sloop ''[[HMS Liberty (1768)|Liberty]]'' in 1768 on suspicions of smuggling triggered a riot. In response, British troops occupied Boston, and Parliament threatened to [[Treason Act 1543|extradite colonists]] to face trial in England.<ref>Knollenberg, Growth, 69</ref> Tensions rose after the murder of [[Christopher Seider]] by a customs official in 1770 and escalated into outrage after British troops fired on civilians in the [[Boston Massacre]].<ref>{{cite web|title=What was the Boston Massacre?|website=Boston Massacre Society|url=http://www.bostonmassacre.net/}}</ref> In 1772, colonists in [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] boarded and burned a [[Gaspee Affair|customs schooner]]. Parliament then repealed all taxes except the one on tea, passing the [[Tea Act]] in 1773, attempting to force colonists to buy [[East India Company]] tea on which the Townshend duties were paid, thus implicitly agreeing to Parliamentary supremacy. The landing of the tea was resisted in all colonies, but the [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|governor of Massachusetts]] permitted British tea ships to remain in [[Boston Harbor]], so the [[Sons of Liberty]] destroyed the tea chests in what became known as the \"[[Boston Tea Party]]\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Boston Tea Party|website=History.com.|accessdate=|url=http://www.history.com/topics/american-revolution/boston-tea-party}}</ref>\n\nParliament then passed punitive legislation.

On April 19, 1782, the Dutch formally recognized the United States as a sovereign power, enhancing American leverage at the negotiations. Spain initially impeded the negotiations, refusing to enter into peace talks until Gibraltar had been captured. The Comte de Vergennes proposed that American territory be confined to the east of the Appalachians; Britain would have sovereignty over the [[Northwest Territory|area north of the Ohio River]], below which an [[Indian barrier state]] would be established under Spanish control.

Howe decided upon the latter, determining that Washington was of a greater threat. When Howe launched his campaign, he took his army upon a time-consuming route through the Chesapeake Bay, rather than the more sensible choices of overland through New Jersey, or by sea through the Delaware Bay. The move left him unable to assist Burgoyne even if it was required of him. The decision so angered Parliament, that Howe was accused by Tories on both sides of the Atlantic of treason.<ref name=\"Campaign of 1777\" />\n\nDuring the Philadelphia campaign, Howe failed to pursue and destroy the defeated Americans on two occasions; once after the [[Battle of Brandywine]],<ref name=\"Higginbotham pp. 181\" /><ref name=\"Adams, Charles Francis p. 43\" /> and again after the [[Battle of Germantown]].<ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\" /> At the [[Battle of White Marsh]], Howe failed to even attempt to exploit the vulnerable American rear,<ref name=\"auto1\" /> and then inexplicably ordered a retreat to Philadelphia after only minor skirmishes, astonishing both sides.<ref name=\"McGuire, p. 254\" /> While the Americans wintered only twenty miles away, Howe made no effort to attack their camp, which critics argue could have ended the war.<ref name=\"Noel Fairchild Busch 1974\" /><ref name=\"A Concluding Commentary\" /><ref name=\"history.army.mil\" /> Following the conclusion of the campaign, Howe resigned his commission, and was replaced by Henry Clinton on May 24, 1778.<ref name=\"Frances H. Kennedy 2014 163\" />\n\nContrary to Howe's more hostile critics, however, there were strategic factors at play which impeded aggressive action. Howe may have been dissuaded from pursuing aggressive manoeuvres due to the memory of the grievous losses the British suffered at Bunker Hill.<ref>Frothingham pp. 152–53</ref><ref>Jackson, Kenneth T; Dunbar, David S (2005).

This decision dangerously exposed the individual forces to defeat in detail, as the distance between them was such that they could not mutually support each other. This strategic failure allowed the Americans to achieve victory at the [[Battle of Trenton]], and the concurrent [[Battle of Princeton]].<ref>Correspondence of George III with Lord North, Volume II, p. 57</ref> While a major strategic error to divide an army in such a manner, the quantity of available food supplies in New York was so low that Howe had been compelled to take such a decision. The garrisons were widely spaced so their respective foraging parties would not interfere with each other's efforts.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:93, Howe to Germain, 30 Nov 1776</ref> Howe's difficulties during the Philadelphia campaign were also greatly exacerbated by the poor quality and quantity of available provisions.<ref>Stedman, American War, Volume I, p. 287</ref>\n\n===== Clinton and Cornwallis =====\n[[File:First Marquis of Cornwallis.jpg|thumb|General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]] led British forces in the [[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War|southern campaign]].]]\n\nIn 1780, the primary British strategy hinged upon a Loyalist uprising in the south, for which Charles Cornwallis was chiefly responsible. After an encouraging success at [[Battle of Camden|Camden]], Cornwallis was poised to invade North Carolina. However, any significant Loyalist support had been effectively destroyed at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]], and the British Legion, the cream of his army, had been decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Cowpens]]. Following both defeats, Cornwallis was fiercely criticized for detaching a significant portion of his army without adequate mutual support.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Despite the defeats, Cornwallis chose to proceed into North Carolina, gambling his success upon a large Loyalist uprising which never materialized.<ref name=\"Lumpkin 2000\">Lumpkin, From Savannah to Yorktown: The American Revolution in the South (2000).</ref> As a result, subsequent engagements cost Cornwallis valuable troops he could not replace, as at the [[Battle of Guilford Courthouse]],<ref name=\"MtVernon\" /> and the Americans steadily wore his army down in an exhaustive [[war of attrition]]. Cornwallis had thus left the Carolinas ripe for reconquest. The Americans had largely achieved this aim by the end of 1781, effectively confining the British to the coast, and undoing all the progress they had made in the previous year.<ref>Pancake, John (1985). This Destructive War. University of Alabama Press. p. 221</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nIn a last-ditch attempt to win the war in the South, Cornwallis resolved to invade Virginia, in order to cut off the American's supply base to the Carolinas. Henry Clinton, Cornwallis' superior, strongly opposed the plan, believing the decisive confrontations would take place with Washington in the North.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> London had approved Cornwallis plan, however they had failed to include Clinton in the decision-making, despite his seniority over Cornwallis, leading to a muddled strategic direction.<ref name=\"Public Record Office\" /> Cornwallis then decided to invade Virginia without informing Clinton of his intentions.<ref>Clinton, H.; ''The American Rebellion''. Note: This lack of notification was one of Clinton's main arguments in his own defense in the controversy that followed the surrender at Yorktown.</ref> Clinton, however, had wholly failed to construct a coherent strategy for British campaigning that year,<ref name=\"auto3\" /> owing to his fractious relationship that he shared with Mariot Arbuthnot, his naval counterpart.<ref name=\"Billias 1969\" />\n\nAs the Franco-American army approached Cornwallis at Yorktown, he made no attempt to [[sally (military)|sally out]] and engage before siege lines could be erected,  despite the repeated urging of his subordinate officers.<ref name=\"Ketchum, p. 205\" /> Expecting [[relief (military)|relief]] to soon arrive from Clinton, Cornwallis prematurely abandoned all of his outer defences, which were then promptly occupied by the besiegers, serving to hasten the British defeat.<ref>Lengel, Edward (2005). General George Washington.

They had no national government, no national army or navy, no financial system, no banks, no established credit, and no functioning government departments, such as a treasury. The Congress tried to handle administrative affairs through legislative committees, which proved inefficient. The state governments were themselves brand new and officials had no administrative experience. In peacetime the colonies relied heavily on ocean travel and shipping, but that was now shut down by the British blockade and the Americans had to rely on slow overland travel.\n\nHowever, the Americans had multiple advantages that in the long run outweighed the initial disadvantages they faced. The Americans had a large prosperous population that depended not on imports but on local production for food and most supplies, while the British were mostly shipped in from across the ocean. The British faced a vast territory far larger than Britain or France, located at a far distance from home ports. Most of the Americans lived on farms distant from the seaports—the British could capture any port but that did not give them control over the hinterland. They were on their home ground, had a smoothly functioning, well organized system of local and state governments, newspapers and printers, and internal lines of communications. They had a long-established system of local militia, previously used to combat the French and Native Americans, with companies and an officer corps that could form the basis of local militias, and provide a training ground for the national army created by Congress.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Pole and Greene, eds. '' Companion to the American Revolution'', ch. 36–39.</ref>\n\nMotivation was a major asset. The Patriots wanted to win; over 200,000 fought in the war; 25,000 died. The British expected the Loyalists to do much of the fighting, but they did much less than expected. The British also hired German mercenaries to do much of their fighting.<ref name=\"Michael Lanning 2009 195–96\" />\n\nAt the onset of the war, the Americans had no major international allies. Battles such as the [[Battle of Bennington]], the [[Battles of Saratoga]] and even defeats such as the [[Battle of Germantown]]<ref name=\"Trevelyan, p. 249\">Trevelyan, p. 249.</ref> proved decisive in gaining the attention and support of powerful European nations such as France and Spain, who moved from covertly supplying the Americans with weapons and supplies, to overtly supporting them militarily, moving the war to a global stage.<ref name=\"K405_48\">[[#Ketchum|Ketchum (1997)]], pp. 405–48.</ref><ref>David Allison, ''The American Revolution: A World War'' (2018)</ref>\n\nThe new Continental Army suffered significantly from a lack of an effective training regime, and largely inexperienced officers and sergeants. The inexperience of its officers was compensated for in part by a few senior officers. The Americans solved their training dilemma during their stint in Winter Quarters at Valley Forge, where they were relentlessly drilled and trained by General [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]], a veteran of the famed Prussian General Staff. He taught the Continental Army the essentials of military discipline, drills, tactics and strategy, and wrote the [[Revolutionary War Drill Manual]].<ref>Philander D.

Each colony sponsored local [[militia]]. Militiamen were lightly armed, had little training, and usually did not have uniforms. Their units served for only a few weeks or months at a time, were reluctant to travel far from home and thus were unavailable for extended operations, and lacked the training and discipline of soldiers with more experience. If properly used, however, their numbers could help the Continental armies overwhelm smaller British forces, as at the [[Battles of the American Revolutionary War|battles]] of [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Concord]], [[Battle of Bennington|Bennington]] and [[Saratoga campaign|Saratoga]], and the [[siege of Boston]]. Both sides used partisan warfare but the Americans effectively suppressed Loyalist activity when [[British Regulars|British regulars]] were not in the area.<ref name=\"Black 2001 p. 59\" />\n\nSeeking to coordinate military efforts, the [[First Continental Congress|Continental Congress]] established a regular army on June 14, 1775, and appointed [[George Washington]] as commander-in-chief.

The largest force Washington commanded was certainly under 17,000,<ref>Boatner (1974), p.&nbsp;264.</ref> and may have been no more than 13,000 troops, and even the combined American and French forces at the siege of Yorktown amounted to only about 19,000.<ref name=\"Duffy-p13\">Duffy, Christopher (2005).

Don Higginbotham, ''George Washington and the American Military Tradition'' (1985) ch 3</ref>\n\nFirst, he designed the overall strategy of the war, in cooperation with Congress. The goal was always independence.  When France entered the war, he worked closely with the soldiers it sent&nbsp;– they were decisive in the great victory at Yorktown in 1781.<ref>Robert Selig, ''March to victory: Washington, Rochambeau, and the Yorktown Campaign of 1781'' (2005) [https://history.army.mil/html/books/rochambeau/index.html online].</ref>\n\nSecond, he provided leadership of troops against the main British forces in 1775–77 and again in 1781. He lost many of his battles, but he never surrendered his army during the war, and he continued to fight the British relentlessly until the war's end.  Washington worked hard to develop a successful espionage system to detect British locations and plans. In 1778, he formed the [[Culper Ring]] to spy on enemy movements in New York City. In 1780 it discovered [[Benedict Arnold]] was a traitor.<ref>Alexander Rose, ''Washington's Spies'' (2006) pp. 258–61.</ref>  The British put a low value on intelligence, and its operations were of poor quality until 1780, when it finally inserted some spies with Congress and with Washington's command. Even then, however, British commanders ignored or downplayed threats that were revealed. The most serious intelligence failure came in 1781 when top commanders were unaware that The American and French armies at both left the Northeast and marched down to Yorktown, where they outnumbered Cornwallis by more than 2 to 1.<ref>Roger Kaplan, \"The Hidden War: British Intelligence Operations during the American Revolution.\" ''William and Mary Quarterly'' (1990) 47#1: 115–38. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2938043 online]</ref>\n\nThird, he was charged selecting and guiding the generals. In June 1776, Congress made its first attempt at running the war effort with the committee known as \"Board of War and Ordnance\", succeeded by the Board of War in July 1777, a committee which eventually included members of the military.<ref>{{cite book|author=William Gardner Bell|title=Commanding Generals and Chiefs of Staff, 1775–2005: Portraits & Biographical Sketches of the United States Army's Senior Officer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xwyykzbi4pUC&pg=PA3|year=2005|pages=3–4|isbn=9780160873300}}</ref><ref>Douglas S. Freeman, and Richard Harwell, ''Washington'' (1968) p. 42.</ref> The command structure of the armed forces was a hodgepodge of Congressional appointees (and Congress sometimes made those appointments without Washington's input) with state-appointments filling the lower ranks. The results of his general staff were mixed, as some of his favorites never mastered the art of command, such as [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]]. Eventually, he found capable officers such as [[Nathanael Greene]], [[Daniel Morgan]], [[Henry Knox]] (chief of artillery), and [[Alexander Hamilton]] (chief of staff). The American officers never equaled their opponents in tactics and maneuver, and they lost most of the pitched battles. The great successes at Boston (1776), [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] (1777), and [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] (1781) came from trapping the British far from base with much larger numbers of troops.<ref>Higginbotham, ''George Washington and the American Military Tradition'' (1985) ch 3</ref>\n\nFourth he took charge of training the army and providing supplies, from food to gunpowder to tents. He recruited regulars and assigned Baron [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]], a veteran of the Prussian general staff, to train them. He transformed Washington's army into a disciplined and effective force.<ref>Arnold Whitridge, \"Baron von Steuben, Washington's Drillmaster.\" ''History Today'' (July 1976) 26#7 pp. 429–36.</ref>   The war effort and getting supplies to the troops were under the purview of Congress, but Washington pressured the Congress to provide the essentials. There was never nearly enough.<ref>E. Wayne Carp, ''To Starve the Army at Pleasure: Continental Army Administration and American Political Culture, 1775–1783'' (1990) p. 220.</ref>\n\nWashington's fifth and most important role in the war effort was the embodiment of armed resistance to the Crown, serving as the representative man of the Revolution. His long-term strategy was to maintain an army in the field at all times, and eventually this strategy worked. His enormous personal and political stature and his political skills kept Congress, the army, the French, the militias, and the states all pointed toward a common goal. Furthermore, he permanently established the principle of civilian supremacy in military affairs by voluntarily resigning his commission and disbanding his army when the war was won, rather than declaring himself monarch. He also helped to overcome the distrust of a standing army by his constant reiteration that well-disciplined professional soldiers counted for twice as much as poorly trained and led militias.<ref>Edward G. Lengel, ''General George Washington: A Military Life'' (2005) pp. 365–71.</ref>\n\n=== African Americans ===\n[[File:Soldiers at the siege of Yorktown (1781), by Jean-Baptiste-Antoine DeVerger.png|thumb|1780 drawing of American soldiers from the [[Yorktown campaign]] shows a black infantryman from the [[1st Rhode Island Regiment]].]]\n\n[[African Americans in the Revolutionary War|African Americans]]—slave and free—served on both sides during the war. The British recruited slaves belonging to [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] masters and promised freedom to those who served by act of Lord [[Dunmore's Proclamation]]. Because of manpower shortages, George Washington lifted the ban on black enlistment in the Continental Army in January 1776. Small all-black units were formed in [[Rhode Island]] and [[Massachusetts]]; many slaves were promised freedom for serving. Some of the men promised freedom were sent back to their masters, after the war was over, out of political convenience. Another all-black unit came from [[Saint-Domingue]] with French colonial forces. At least 5,000 black soldiers fought for the Revolutionary cause.<ref>Kaplan and Kaplan (1989), pp.&nbsp;64–69.</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Leslie Alexander|title=Encyclopedia of African American History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uivtCqOlpTsC&pg=PA356|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=356|isbn=978-1-85109-774-6}}</ref>\n\nTens of thousands of slaves escaped during the war and joined British lines; others simply moved off in the chaos. For instance, in South Carolina, nearly 25,000 slaves (30% of the enslaved population) fled, migrated or died during the disruption of the war.<ref>Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery: 1619–1877'', New York: Hill and Wang, 1994, p. 73</ref> This greatly disrupted plantation production during and after the war. When they withdrew their forces from Savannah and Charleston, the British also evacuated 10,000 slaves belonging to Loyalists.<ref>Kolchin, p. 73</ref> Altogether, the British evacuated nearly 20,000 blacks at the end of the war. More than 3,000 of them were freedmen and most of these were resettled in Nova Scotia; other blacks were sold in the West Indies.<ref>{{cite book|author=William Weir|title=The Encyclopedia of African American Military History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WEXj4gHHARgC&pg=PA32|year=2004|publisher=Prometheus Books|pages=31–32|isbn=978-1-61592-831-6}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Pybus|first=Cassandra|date=2005|title=Jefferson's Faulty Math: The Question of Slave Defections in the American Revolution|journal=The William and Mary Quarterly|volume=62|issue=2|pages=243–264|doi=10.2307/3491601|jstor=3491601}}</ref>\n\n=== American Indians ===\n[[File:ContinentalArmy LeffertsWatercolor.jpg|thumb|A watercolor painting depicting a variety of Continental Army soldiers]]\n\nMost [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] east of the [[Mississippi River]] were affected by the war, and many tribes were divided over the question of how to respond to the conflict. A few tribes were on friendly terms with the other Americans, but most Indians opposed the union of the Colonies as a potential threat to their territory. Approximately 13,000 Indians fought on the British side, with the largest group coming from the [[Iroquois]] tribes, who fielded around 1,500 men.<ref>Greene and Pole (1999), p.&nbsp;393; Boatner (1974), p.&nbsp;545.</ref> The powerful [[Iroquois Confederacy]] was shattered as a result of the conflict, whatever side they took; the [[Seneca nation|Seneca]], [[Onondaga (tribe)|Onondaga]], and [[Cayuga nation|Cayuga]] nations sided with the British. Members of the [[Mohawk nation]] fought on both sides. Many [[Tuscarora (tribe)|Tuscarora]] and [[Oneida tribe|Oneida]] sided with the colonists. The Continental Army sent the [[Sullivan Expedition]] on raids throughout New York to cripple the Iroquois tribes that had sided with the British. Mohawk leaders [[Joseph Louis Cook]] and [[Joseph Brant]] sided with the Americans and the British respectively, and this further exacerbated the split.\n\nEarly in July 1776, a major action occurred in the fledgling conflict when the [[Cherokee]] allies of Britain attacked the [[Washington District, North Carolina|western frontier areas]] of [[North Carolina Colony|North Carolina]]. Their defeat resulted in a splintering of the Cherokee settlements and people, and was directly responsible for the rise of the [[Chickamauga Cherokee]], bitter enemies of the Colonials who carried on a [[Cherokee–American wars|frontier war]] for decades following the end of hostilities with Britain.<ref name=finger1>John Finger, ''Tennessee Frontiers: Three Regions in Transition'' (Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University Press, 2001), pp. 43–64.</ref>\n\n[[Muscogee people|Creek]] and [[Seminole]] allies of Britain fought against Americans in Georgia and South Carolina.

He reports that warfare and the farming culture were sometimes incompatible. Militiamen found that living and working on the family farm had not prepared them for wartime marches and the rigors of camp life. Rugged individualism conflicted with military discipline and regimentation. A man's birth order often influenced his military recruitment, as younger sons went to war and older sons took charge of the farm. A person's family responsibilities and the prevalent patriarchy could impede mobilization. Harvesting duties and family emergencies pulled men home regardless of the sergeant's orders. Some relatives might be Loyalists, creating internal strains. On the whole, historians conclude the Revolution's effect on patriarchy and inheritance patterns favored [[egalitarianism]].<ref>William Baller, \"Farm Families and the American Revolution,\" ''Journal of Family History'' (2006) 31(1): 28–44. {{ISSN|0363-1990}}.

The Assembly balanced the competing demands of elite slave-owning planters, [[Plain Folk of the Old South|the middling yeomen]] (some owning a few slaves), and landless indentured servants, among other groups. The Assembly used deferments, taxes, military service substitute, and conscription to resolve the tensions. Unresolved class conflict, however, made these laws less effective. There were violent protests, many cases of evasion, and large-scale desertion, so that Virginia's contributions came at embarrassingly low levels. With the British invasion of the state in 1781, Virginia was mired in class division as its native son, George Washington, made desperate appeals for troops.<ref>Michael A.

Fought on 22 August 1485, the battle was won by the Lancastrians. In reality, The House of Lancaster had no members left eligible for the royal succession and Henry VII invaded England—in which he had never lived—under the flimsiest of pretexts. While true that he had fourth-generation, maternal Lancastrian descendancy, Henry seized the crown by right of conquest.\n\nThe nominal-Lancastrian leader [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]], by his victory became the first English monarch of the [[Tudor dynasty]]. His opponent, [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], the last king of the House of York, was killed in the battle. Historians consider Bosworth Field to mark the end of the [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet dynasty]], making it a defining moment of English and Welsh history. This acknowledges how Henry VII was not in fact eligible for legal succession, as a Lancastrian. Nor was he invited to rule due to the incumbent dynasty—Plantagenet, House of York—ending for lack of an heir.\n\nRichard III's reign began in 1483. At the request of his brother [[Edward IV]], Richard was acting as [[Lord Protector]] for his twelve-year-old son [[Edward V]]. Richard had Parliament declare Edward V illegitimate and ineligible for the throne and replaced him. There was in fact some basis for questioning Edward V's legitimacy, while Richard was constrained to do so in order to protect himself from [[Elizabeth Woodville]]—Edward V's mother, and Regent—seizing control. Given her legacy—with Edward IV and Richard's brother [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence]] murdered in the Tower after questioning the legitimacy of Edward IV's marriage to Elizabeth—Richard III was hardly safe. It was an internal power struggle, later portrayed as inexcusable by Henry Tudor in order to justify his kingship. In reality, it is likely Tudor would have invaded the divided country regardless of its ruler.\n\nRichard lost popularity when Edward V, still a child, and his younger brother disappeared after he incarcerated them in the [[Tower of London]], although the more credible suspect in their eventual deaths is thought to be [[Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham]], who was planning the rebellion which soon occurred. Unlike Richard, Buckingham showed himself to be ruthless, while the boys were all that stood between him and the throne. It was later claimed that Richard's support was further eroded by the popular belief that he was implicated in the death of his wife, [[Anne Neville]]. It is likely this is largely Tudor propaganda, as Richard was a pious man, devoted to his family. However, it is true he was faced with a very difficult beginning to his reign, given the unexpected death of his elder brother Edward IV, the questions of legitimacy surrounding Edward and his family, and queen-consort Elizabeth Woodville's determination to take control, a trait she had displayed throughout her queenship.\n\nAcross the [[English Channel]] in [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]], Henry Tudor, a descendant of the destroyed House of Lancaster, seized on Richard's difficulties. Henry's first attempt to invade England was frustrated by a storm in 1483, but on his second attempt he arrived unopposed on 7 August 1485 on the southwest coast of Wales. Marching inland, Henry gathered support as he made for London. Richard mustered his troops and intercepted Henry's army south of [[Market Bosworth]] in Leicestershire. Lord [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby|Thomas Stanley]] and Sir [[William Stanley (Battle of Bosworth)|William Stanley]] brought a force to the battlefield, but held back. Officially, they were deciding which side it would be more advantageous to support, but in reality they had an agreement with Henry. Thomas Stanley, one of the most powerful lords in the land, was married to Henry's mother, Margaret Beaufort. Allowing such a union would prove fatal to Richard.\n\nRichard divided his army, which outnumbered Henry's, into three groups (or \"battles\"). One was assigned to the [[John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] and another to the [[Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]]. Henry kept most of his force together and placed it under the command of the experienced [[John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford|Earl of Oxford]]. Richard's vanguard, commanded by Norfolk, attacked but struggled against Oxford's men, and some of Norfolk's troops fled the field. Northumberland took no action when signalled to assist his king, so Richard gambled everything on a charge across the battlefield to kill Henry and end the fight. Seeing the King's knights separated from his army, the Stanleys intervened; Sir William led his men to Henry's aid, surrounding and killing Richard. After the battle Henry was crowned king below an oak tree in nearby Stoke Golding, now a residential garden.\n\nHenry hired chroniclers to portray his reign favourably; the Battle of Bosworth was popularised to represent the Tudor dynasty as the start of a new age.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b4KfBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA174&dq=henry+tudor+chroniclers&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiWheXY0arcAhUIUa0KHeuyDCIQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&q=henry%20tudor%20chroniclers&f=false|title=The Revolt of Owain Glyndwr in Medieval English Chronicles|last=Marchant|first=Alicia|date=2014|publisher=Boydell & Brewer Ltd|isbn=9781903153550|language=en}}</ref> From the 15th to the 18th centuries the battle was glamorised as a victory of good over evil. The climax of [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' provides a focal point for critics in later film adaptations. The exact site of the battle is disputed because of the lack of conclusive data, and memorials have been erected at different locations. In 1974 the Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre was built on a site that has since been challenged by several scholars and historians. In October 2009 a team of researchers, who had performed geological surveys and archaeological digs in the area from 2003, suggested a location {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} southwest of [[Ambion Hill]].\n\n==Background==\n{{further|Wars of the Roses|Princes in the Tower}}\n<!-- This section is neither for determining Richard's involvement in the Princes' death, nor his motivations behind his taking the throne or the actions in doing so.

The highest-ranking conspirator was Buckingham.

Although a king could raise personal militia from his lands, he could only muster a significantly large army through the support of his nobles. Richard, like his predecessors, had to win over these men by granting gifts and maintaining cordial relationships.{{sfn|Downing|1992|pp=159–160}} Powerful nobles could demand greater incentives to remain on the liege's side or else they might turn against him.{{sfn|Downing|1992|p=59}} Three groups, each with its own agenda, stood on Bosworth Field: Richard III and his Yorkist army; his challenger, Henry Tudor, who championed the Lancastrian cause; and the fence-sitting Stanleys.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=47}}\n\n===Yorkist===\nSmall and slender, Richard III did not have the robust physique associated with many of his Plantagenet predecessors.{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=138}}  However, he enjoyed very rough sports and activities that were considered manly.{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=142}} His performances on the battlefield impressed his brother greatly, and he became Edward's right-hand man.{{sfn|Ross|1999|pp=21–22}} During the 1480s Richard defended the northern borders of England.

Norfolk was due to inherit a share of the wealthy Mowbray estate on the death of eight-year-old [[Anne de Mowbray, 8th Countess of Norfolk|Anne de Mowbray]], the last of her family. However, Edward convinced Parliament to circumvent the law of inheritance and transfer the estate to his younger son, who was married to Anne. Consequently, Howard supported Richard III in deposing Edward's sons, for which he received the dukedom of Norfolk and his original share of the Mowbray estate.{{sfn|Ross|1999|pp=35–38, 175}}\n\n[[Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland]], also supported Richard's seizure of the throne of England. The Percys were loyal Lancastrians, but Edward IV eventually won the earl's allegiance. Northumberland had been captured and imprisoned by the Yorkists in 1461, losing his titles and estates; however, Edward released him eight years later and restored his earldom.{{sfn|Hicks|2002|p=280}} From that time Northumberland served the Yorkist crown, helping to defend northern England and maintain its peace.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=180}} Initially the earl had issues with Richard III as Edward groomed his brother to be the leading power of the north. Northumberland was mollified when he was promised he would be the [[Lord Warden of the Marches|Warden of the East March]], a position that was formerly hereditary for the Percys.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=185}} He served under Richard during the 1482 invasion of Scotland, and the allure of being in a position to dominate the north of England if Richard went south to assume the crown was his likely motivation for supporting Richard's bid for kingship.{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=78}} However, after becoming king, Richard began moulding his nephew, [[John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln]], to manage the north, passing over Northumberland for the position.

At the Battle of Barnet, he commanded the Lancastrian right wing and routed the division opposing him. However, as a result of confusion over identities, Oxford's group came under [[friendly fire]] from the Lancastrian main force and retreated from the field. The earl fled abroad and continued his fight against the Yorkists, raiding shipping and eventually capturing the island fort of [[St Michael's Mount]] in 1473. He surrendered after receiving no aid or reinforcement, but in 1484 escaped from prison and joined Henry's court in France, bringing along his erstwhile gaoler [[James Blount|Sir James Blount]].{{sfn|Britnell|1997|p=101}}  Oxford's presence raised morale in Henry's camp and troubled Richard III.{{sfn|Gravett|1999|p=15}}\n\n===Stanleys===\nIn the early stages of the Wars of the Roses, the Stanleys of Cheshire had been predominantly Lancastrians.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=159}}  Sir [[William Stanley (Battle of Bosworth)|William Stanley]], however, was a staunch Yorkist supporter, fighting in the [[Battle of Blore Heath]] in 1459 and helping Hastings to put down uprisings against Edward IV in 1471.<ref>{{harvnb|Hicks|2002|p=163}}; {{harvnb|Ross|1997|p=164}}.</ref> When Richard took the crown, Sir William showed no inclination to turn against the new king, refraining from joining Buckingham's rebellion, for which he was amply rewarded.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=212}}  Sir William's elder brother, [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby|Thomas Stanley, 2nd Baron Stanley]], was not as steadfast. By 1485, he had served three kings, namely [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], [[Edward IV]], and [[Richard III]]. [[Lord Stanley]]'s skilled political manoeuvrings—vacillating between opposing sides until it was clear who would be the winner—gained him high positions;{{sfn|Coward|1983|pp=2, 9–10}} he was Henry's chamberlain and Edward's steward.{{sfn|Ross|1997|p=334}}  His non-committal stance, until the crucial point of a battle, earned him the loyalty of his men, who felt he would not needlessly send them to their deaths.{{sfn|Gravett|1999|p=15}}\n\n[[Lord Stanley]]'s relations with the king's brother, the eventual [[Richard III]], were not cordial. The two had conflicts that erupted into violence around March 1470.{{sfn|Ross|1997|p=134}}  Furthermore, having taken [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby|Lady Margaret]] as his second wife in June 1472,{{sfn|Jones|Underwood|1993|p=59}} Stanley was Henry Tudor's stepfather, a relationship which did nothing to win him Richard's favour. Despite these differences, Stanley did not join [[Buckingham's revolt]] in 1483.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=212}}  When Richard executed those conspirators who had been unable to flee [[England]],{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=117}} he spared Lady Margaret. However, he declared her titles forfeit and transferred her estates to Stanley's name, to be held in trust for the [[Yorkist]] crown. Richard's act of mercy was calculated to reconcile him with Stanley,{{sfn|Jones|Underwood|1993|p=64}} but it may have been to no avail—Carpenter has identified a further cause of friction in Richard's intention to reopen an old land dispute that involved Thomas Stanley and the Harrington family.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=216}}  Edward IV had ruled the case in favour of Stanley in 1473,{{sfn|Ross|1997|p=409}} but Richard planned to overturn his brother's ruling and give the wealthy estate to the Harringtons.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=216}}  Immediately before the Battle of Bosworth, being wary of Stanley, Richard took his son, [[George Stanley, 9th Baron Strange|Lord Strange]], as hostage to discourage him from joining Henry.{{sfn|Horrox|1991|p=323}}\n\n==Crossing the English Channel and through Wales==\n\nHenry's initial force consisted of the English and Welsh exiles who had gathered around Henry, combined with a contingent of mercenaries put at his disposal by [[Charles VIII of France]]. The history of one \"John Major\" (published in 1521) claims that Charles had granted Henry 5,000 men, of whom 1,000 were Scots, headed by Sir Alexander Bruce. No mention of Scottish soldiers was made by subsequent English historians.{{sfn|Skidmore|2013|p=224}}\n\nHenry's crossing of the [[English Channel]] in 1485 was without incident. Thirty ships sailed from [[Harfleur]] on 1 August and, with fair winds behind them, landed in his native [[Wales]], at Mill Bay (near [[Dale, Pembrokeshire|Dale]]) on the north side of [[Milford Haven]] on 7 August, easily capturing nearby [[Dale Castle]].{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|pp=40–41, 342}} Henry received a muted response from the local population. No joyous welcome awaited him on shore, and at first few individual Welshmen joined his army as it marched inland.{{sfn|Ross|1999|pp=211–212}} Historian [[Geoffrey Elton]] suggests only Henry's ardent supporters felt pride over his Welsh blood.{{sfn|Elton|2003|pp=88–89}} His arrival had been hailed by contemporary Welsh bards such as Dafydd Ddu and Gruffydd ap Dafydd as the true prince and \"the youth of Brittany defeating the [[Saxons]]\" in order to bring their country back to glory.{{sfn|Elton|2003|p=89}}{{sfn|Skidmore|2013|p=207}} When Henry moved to [[Haverfordwest]], the county town of [[Pembrokeshire]], Richard's lieutenant in South Wales, Sir Walter Herbert, failed to move against Henry, and two of his officers, Richard Griffith and Evan Morgan, deserted to Henry with their men.{{sfn|Rowse|1998|p=215}}\n\nThe most important defector to Henry in this early stage of the campaign was probably Rhys ap Thomas, who was the leading figure in West Wales.{{sfn|Rowse|1998|p=215}} Richard had appointed Rhys Lieutenant in West Wales for his refusal to join Buckingham's rebellion, asking that he surrender his son [[Gruffydd ap Rhys ap Thomas]] as surety, although by some accounts Rhys had managed to evade this condition. However, Henry successfully courted Rhys, offering the lieutenancy of all Wales in exchange for his fealty. Henry marched via [[Aberystwyth]] while Rhys followed a more southerly route, recruiting a force of Welshmen en route, variously estimated at 500 or 2,000 men, to swell Henry's army when they reunited at [[Long Mountain (Powys)|Cefn Digoll]], [[Welshpool]],.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|pp=42–43}} By 15 or 16 August, Henry and his men had crossed the English border, making for the town of [[Shrewsbury]].{{sfn|Gravett|1999|p=40}}\n\n==Shrewsbury: the gateway to England==\n[[File:Henry Tudor and Rhys ap Thomas' march through Wales translated from Welsh.svg|thumb|500px|March through Wales, to Bosworth Field.]]\nSince 22 June 1485 Richard had been aware of Henry's impending invasion, and had ordered his lords to maintain a high level of readiness.{{sfn|Ross|1999|pp=208–209}}  News of Henry's landing reached Richard on 11 August, but it took three to four days for his messengers to notify his lords of their king's mobilisation. On 16 August, the Yorkist army started to gather; Norfolk set off for [[Leicester]], the assembly point, that night. The city of York, a traditional stronghold of Richard's family, asked the king for instructions, and receiving a reply three days later sent 80&nbsp;men to join the king. Simultaneously Northumberland, whose northern territory was the most distant from the capital, had gathered his men and ridden to Leicester.{{sfn|Ross|1999|pp=212–215}}\n\nAlthough London was his goal,{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=44}} Henry did not move directly towards the city. After resting in Shrewsbury, his forces went eastwards and picked up [[Gilbert Talbot (soldier)|Sir Gilbert Talbot]] and other English allies, including deserters from Richard's forces. Although its size had increased substantially since the landing, Henry's army was still substantially outnumbered by Richard's forces. Henry's pace through [[Staffordshire]] was slow, delaying the confrontation with Richard so that he could gather more recruits to his cause.{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=212}} Henry had been communicating on friendly terms with the Stanleys for some time before setting foot in England,{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=39}} and the Stanleys had mobilised their forces on hearing of Henry's landing.

Henry had no choice but to confront Richard's forces alone.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=47}}\n\nWell aware of his own military inexperience, Henry handed command of his army to Oxford and retired to the rear with his bodyguards. Oxford, seeing the vast line of Richard's army strung along the ridgeline, decided to keep his men together instead of splitting them into the traditional three battles: vanguard, centre, and rearguard. He ordered the troops to stray no further than {{convert|10|ft|m}} from their banners, fearing that they would become enveloped. Individual groups clumped together, forming a single large mass flanked by horsemen on the wings.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=48}}\n\nThe Lancastrians were harassed by Richard's cannon as they manoeuvred around the marsh, seeking firmer ground.{{sfn|Ross|1999|pp=220–221}}  Once Oxford and his men were clear of the marsh, Norfolk's battle and several contingents of Richard's group, under the command of Sir [[Robert Brackenbury]], started to advance. Hails of arrows showered both sides as they closed. Oxford's men proved the steadier in the ensuing hand-to-hand combat; they held their ground and several of Norfolk's men fled the field.{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=19}} Norfolk lost one of his senior officers, [[Walter Devereux, 7th Baron Ferrers of Chartley|Walter Devereux]] in this early clash.<ref>C.

He led a charge of mounted men around the melee and tore into Henry's group; several accounts state that Richard's force numbered 800–1000&nbsp;knights, but Ross says it was more likely that Richard was accompanied only by his household men and closest friends.<ref>{{harvnb|Gravett|1999|p=69}}; {{harvnb|Ross|1999|pp=222–224}}.</ref> Richard killed Henry's standard-bearer [[William Brandon (standard-bearer)|Sir William Brandon]] in the initial charge and unhorsed burly [[John Cheyne, Baron Cheyne|John Cheyne]], Edward IV's former standard-bearer,{{sfn|Horrox|1991|p=325}} with a blow to the head from his broken lance.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=49}} French mercenaries in Henry's retinue related how the attack had caught them off guard and that Henry sought protection by dismounting and concealing himself among them to present less of a target. Henry made no attempt to engage in combat himself.{{sfn|Jones|Langley|2013|pp=202, 205}}\n\nOxford had left a small reserve of [[Pike (weapon)|pike]]-equipped men with Henry. They slowed the pace of Richard's mounted charge and bought Tudor some critical time.{{sfn|Jones|Langley|2013|p=203}} The remainder of Henry's bodyguards surrounded their master and succeeded in keeping him away from the Yorkist king. Meanwhile, seeing Richard embroiled with Henry's men and separated from his main force, William Stanley made his move and rode to the aid of Henry. Now outnumbered, Richard's group was surrounded and gradually pressed back.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=49}} Richard's force was driven several hundred yards away from Tudor, near to the edge of a marsh, into which the king's horse toppled. Richard, now unhorsed, gathered himself and rallied his dwindling followers, supposedly refusing to retreat: \"God forbid that I retreat one step. I will either win the battle as a king, or die as one.\"{{sfn|Jones|Langley|2013|p=206}} In the fighting Richard's banner man—Sir [[Percival Thirlwall]]—lost his legs but held the Yorkist banner aloft until he was killed.

Parliament reversed his attainder and recorded Richard's kingship as illegal, although the Yorkist king's reign remained officially in the annals of England history. The proclamation of Edward IV's children as illegitimate was also reversed, restoring Elizabeth's status to a royal princess.{{sfn|Baker|2003|pp=58–59}}  The marriage of Elizabeth, the heiress to the House of York, to Henry, the master of the House of Lancaster, marked the end of the feud between the two houses and the start of the [[Tudor dynasty]]. The royal matrimony, however, was delayed until Henry was crowned king and had established his claim on the throne firmly enough to preclude that of Elizabeth and her kin.{{sfn|Laynesmith|2005|p=81}}  Henry further convinced Parliament to backdate his reign to the day before the battle,{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=20}}  enabling him retrospectively to declare as traitors those who had fought against him at Bosworth Field.{{sfn|Baker|2003|p=59}}  Northumberland, who had remained inactive during the battle, was imprisoned but later released and reinstated to pacify the north in Henry's name.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=222}}  The purge of those who fought for Richard occupied Henry's first two years of rule, although later he proved prepared to accept those who submitted to him regardless of their former allegiances.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|pp=224–225}}\n\nOf his supporters, Henry rewarded the Stanleys the most generously.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=54}} Aside from making William his chamberlain, he bestowed the earldom of Derby upon Lord Stanley along with grants and offices in other estates.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=223}}  Henry rewarded Oxford by restoring to him the lands and titles confiscated by the Yorkists and appointing him as [[Constable of the Tower]] and admiral of England, Ireland, and [[Aquitaine]]. For his kin, Henry created Jasper Tudor the Duke of Bedford.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|pp=54–55}}  He returned to his mother the lands and grants stripped from her by Richard, and proved to be a filial son, granting her a place of honour in the palace and faithfully attending to her throughout his reign. Parliament's declaration of Margaret as ''[[femme sole]]'' effectively empowered her; she no longer needed to manage her estates through Stanley.{{sfn|Jones|Underwood|1993|pp=98–99}}  Elton points out that despite his initial largesse, Henry's supporters at Bosworth would only enjoy his special favour for the short term; in later years, he would instead promote those who best served his interests.{{sfn|Elton|2003|pp=78–80}}\n\nLike the kings before him, Henry faced dissenters. The first open revolt occurred two years after Bosworth Field; [[Lambert Simnel]] claimed to be [[Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick]], who was Edward IV's nephew. The Earl of Lincoln backed him for the throne and led rebel forces in the name of the House of York.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=222}}  The rebel army fended off several attacks by Northumberland's forces, before engaging Henry's army at the [[Battle of Stoke Field]] on 16 June 1487.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=223}}  Oxford and Bedford led Henry's men,{{sfn|Mackie|1983|p=73}} including several former supporters of Richard III.{{sfn|Horrox|1991|p=318}}  Henry won this battle easily, but other malcontents and conspiracies would follow.{{sfn|Pugh|1992|pp=52–56}}  A rebellion in 1489 started with Northumberland's murder; military historian Michael C. C. Adams says that the author of a note, which was left next to Northumberland's body, blamed the earl for Richard's death.{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=20}}\n\n==Legacy and historical significance==\nContemporary accounts of the Battle of Bosworth can be found in four main sources, one of which is the English ''[[Croyland Chronicle]]'', written by a senior Yorkist chronicler who relied on second-hand information from nobles and soldiers.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=6}}  The other accounts were written by foreigners—Vergil, Jean Molinet, and Diego de Valera.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|pp=4, 7}}  Whereas Molinet was sympathetic to Richard,{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=7}} Vergil was in Henry's service and drew information from the king and his subjects to portray them in a good light.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=4}}  Diego de Valera, whose information Ross regards as unreliable,{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=216}} compiled his work from letters of Spanish merchants.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=7}}  However, other historians have used Valera's work to deduce possibly valuable insights not readily evident in other sources.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=8}}  Ross finds the poem, ''[[The Ballad of Bosworth Field]]'', a useful source to ascertain certain details of the battle. The multitude of different accounts, mostly based on second- or third-hand information, has proved an obstacle to historians as they try to reconstruct the battle.{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=216}}  Their common complaint is that, except for its outcome, very few details of the battle are found in the chronicles. According to historian [[Michael Hicks (historian)|Michael Hicks]], the Battle of Bosworth is one of the worst-recorded clashes of the Wars of the Roses.{{sfn|Hicks|1995|p=23}}\n\n===Historical depictions and interpretations===\n[[File:Battle of Bosworth Field re-enactment.jpg|thumb|left|alt=An armoured and mounted man leads a small party, similarly dressed in mediaeval attire, along a road.|[[Newport, Wales|Newport]] History Society re-enacts Henry's march through Wales to Bosworth Field during the battle's quincentenary celebration.]]\nHenry tried to present his victory as a new beginning for the country;{{sfn|Burrow|2000|p=11}} he hired chroniclers to portray his reign as a \"modern age\" with its dawn in 1485.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=219}}  Hicks states that the works of Vergil and the blind historian [[Bernard André]], promoted by subsequent Tudor administrations, became the authoritative sources for writers for the next four hundred years.{{sfn|Hicks|1995|pp=28, 39}}  As such, Tudor literature paints a flattering picture of Henry's reign, depicting the Battle of Bosworth as the final clash of the civil war and downplaying the subsequent uprisings.{{sfn|Hicks|1995|p=23}}  For England the [[Middle Ages]] ended in 1485, and [[English Heritage]] claims that other than [[William the Conqueror]]'s successful [[Battle of Hastings|invasion]] of 1066, no other year holds more significance in English history. By portraying Richard as a hunchbacked tyrant who usurped the throne by killing his nephews, the Tudor historians attached a sense of myth to the battle: it became an epic clash between good and evil with a satisfying moral outcome.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=11}}  According to [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] Colin Burrow, André was so overwhelmed by the historic significance of the battle that he represented it with a blank page in his ''Henry VII'' (1502).{{sfn|Burrow|2000|p=12}}  For Professor Peter Saccio, the battle was indeed a unique clash in the annals of English history, because \"the victory was determined, not by those who fought, but by those who delayed fighting until they were sure of being on the winning side.\"{{sfn|Saccio|2000|p=183}}\n\nHistorians such as Adams and Horrox believe that Richard lost the battle not for any mythic reasons, but because of morale and loyalty problems in his army. Most of the common soldiers found it difficult to fight for a liege whom they distrusted, and some lords believed that their situation might improve if Richard was dethroned.{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=19}}{{sfn|Horrox|1991|p=318}}  According to Adams, against such duplicities Richard's desperate charge was the only knightly behaviour on the field. As fellow historian Michael Bennet puts it, the attack was \"the swan-song of [mediaeval] English chivalry\".{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=20}}  Adams believes this view was shared at the time by the printer [[William Caxton]], who enjoyed sponsorship from Edward IV and Richard III. Nine days after the battle, Caxton published [[Thomas Malory]]'s story about chivalry and death by betrayal—''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''—seemingly as a response to the circumstances of Richard's death.{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=20}}\n\nElton does not believe Bosworth Field has any true significance, pointing out that the 20th-century English public largely ignored the battle until its quincentennial celebration. In his view, the dearth of specific information about the battle—no-one even knows exactly where it took place—demonstrates its insignificance to English society. Elton considers the battle as just one part of Henry's struggles to establish his reign, underscoring his point by noting that the young king had to spend ten more years pacifying factions and rebellions to secure his throne.{{sfn|Elton|2003|p=78}}\n\nMackie asserts that, in hindsight, Bosworth Field is notable as the decisive battle that established a dynasty which would rule unchallenged over England for more than a hundred years.{{sfn|Mackie|1983|p=8}} Mackie notes that contemporary historians of that time, wary of the three royal successions during the long Wars of the Roses, considered Bosworth Field just another in a lengthy series of such battles. It was through the works and efforts of [[Francis Bacon]] and his successors that the public started to believe the battle had decided their futures by bringing about \"the fall of a tyrant\".{{sfn|Mackie|1983|p=7}}\n\n===Shakespearian dramatisation===\n[[William Shakespeare]] gives prominence to the Battle of Bosworth in his play, ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''. It is the \"one big battle\"; no other fighting scene distracts the audience from this action,{{sfn|Grene|2002|p=92}} represented by a one-on-one sword fight between Henry Tudor and Richard III.{{sfn|Edelman|1992|p=80}}  Shakespeare uses their duel to bring a climactic end to the play and the Wars of the Roses; he also uses it to champion morality, portraying the \"unequivocal triumph of good over evil\".{{sfn|Grene|2002|p=93}}  Richard, the villainous lead character, has been built up in the battles of Shakespeare's earlier play, ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]'', as a \"formidable swordsman and a courageous military leader\"—in contrast to the dastardly means by which he becomes king in ''Richard III''.{{sfn|Edelman|1992|p=79}}  Although the Battle of Bosworth has only five sentences to direct it, three scenes and more than four hundred lines precede the action, developing the background and motivations for the characters in anticipation of the battle.{{sfn|Grene|2002|p=93}}\n\n[[File:William Hogarth - David Garrick as Richard III - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A moustached man—dressed in white stockings, puffed breeches, and a red robe—props himself up with his left arm on a bed.

A suit of armour lays on the floor at the foot of his bed.|''Richard III'', Act 5, scene 3: Richard, played by [[David Garrick]], awakens after a nightmare visit by the ghosts of his victims.]]\nShakespeare's account of the battle was mostly based on chroniclers [[Edward Hall]]'s and [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s dramatic versions of history, which were sourced from Vergil's chronicle. However, Shakespeare's attitude towards Richard was shaped by scholar [[Thomas More]], whose writings displayed extreme bias against the Yorkist king.{{sfn|Lull|Shakespeare|1999|p=1}}  The result of these influences is a script that vilifies the king, and Shakespeare had few qualms about departing from history to incite drama.{{sfn|Saccio|2000|p=14}} [[Margaret of Anjou]] died in 1482, but Shakespeare had her speak to Richard's mother before the battle to foreshadow Richard's fate and fulfill the prophecy she had given in ''Henry VI''.{{sfn|Lull|Shakespeare|1999|p=48}}  Shakespeare exaggerated the cause of Richard's restless night before the battle, imagining it as a haunting by the ghosts of those whom the king had murdered, including Buckingham.{{sfn|Grene|2002|p=154}}  Richard is portrayed as suffering a pang of conscience, but as he speaks he regains his confidence and asserts that he will be evil, if such needed to retain his crown.{{sfn|Lull|Shakespeare|1999|p=18}}\n\nThe fight between the two armies is simulated by rowdy noises made off-stage (''alarums'' or alarms) while actors walk on-stage, deliver their lines, and exit. To build anticipation for the duel, Shakespeare requests more ''alarums'' after Richard's councillor, [[William Catesby]], announces that the king is \"[enacting] more wonders than a man\". Richard punctuates his entrance with the classic line, \"A horse, a horse! My kingdom for a horse!\"{{sfn|Edelman|1992|p=80}}  He refuses to withdraw, continuing to seek to slay Henry's doubles until he has killed his nemesis. There is no documentary evidence that Henry had five [[Political decoy|decoys]] at Bosworth Field; the idea was Shakespeare's invention. He drew inspiration from [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]]'s use of them at the [[Battle of Shrewsbury]] (1403) to amplify the perception of Richard's courage on the battlefield.{{sfn|Edelman|1992|p=81}}  Similarly, the single combat between Henry and Richard is Shakespeare's creation. ''[[The True Tragedy of Richard III]]'', by an unknown playwright, earlier than Shakespeare's, has no signs of staging such an encounter: its stage directions give no hint of visible combat.{{sfn|Edelman|1992|pp=16–17}}\n\n[[File:The Battle of Bosworth Field - A Scene from the Great Drama of History.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A view from the back of a stage.

As Richard speaks to his men and draws his plans in the sand using his sword, his units appear on-screen, arraying themselves according to the lines that Richard had drawn. Intimately woven together, the combination of pictorial and narrative elements effectively turns Richard into a storyteller, who acts out the plot he has constructed.{{sfn|Davies|1990|p=75}}  Shakespearian critic Herbert Coursen extends that imagery: Richard sets himself up as a creator of men, but dies amongst the savagery of his creations. Coursen finds the depiction a contrast to that of [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] and his \"band of brothers\".{{sfn|Coursen|2000|pp=100–101}}\n\nThe adaptation of the setting for ''Richard III'' to a 1930s fascist England in [[Ian McKellen]]'s [[Richard III (1995 film)|1995 film]], however, did not sit well with historians. Adams posits that the original Shakespearian setting for Richard's fate at Bosworth teaches the moral of facing one's fate, no matter how unjust it is, \"nobly and with dignity\".{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=28}}  By overshadowing the dramatic teaching with special effects, McKellen's film reduces its version of the battle to a pyrotechnic spectacle about the death of a one-dimensional villain.{{sfn|Adams|2002|pp=28–29}}  Coursen agrees that, in this version, the battle and Richard's end are trite and underwhelming.{{sfn|Coursen|2000|pp=102–103}}\n\n==Battlefield location==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| header    = Richard's Field\n| footer    = The memorial and its plaque\n| footer_align = left\n| width     = 200\n| image1    = King Richard's Field.jpg\n| alt1      = A clearing sparsely surrounded by trees and bushes.

Sparked by the battle's quincentenary celebration in 1985,{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=1}} a dispute among historians has led many to suspect the accuracy of Williams's theory.{{sfn|Dunn|2000|p=2}}{{sfn|Battlefields Trust|2004|loc=\"[http://www.battlefieldstrust.com/resource-centre/warsoftheroses/battlepageview.asp?pageid=387 Visiting the Battlefield]\"}}  In particular, geological surveys conducted from 2003 to 2009 by the Battlefields Trust, a charitable organisation that protects and studies old English battlefields, show that the southern and eastern flanks of Ambion Hill were solid ground in the 15th century, contrary to Williams's claim that it was a large area of marshland.{{sfn|Foard|2004|p=21}} [[Landscape archaeology|Landscape archaeologist]] [[Glenn Foard]], leader of the survey,{{sfn|Williamson|2008|p=2}} said the collected soil samples and finds of medieval military equipment suggest that the battle took place {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} southwest of Ambion Hill (52°34′41″N 1°26′02″W),{{sfn|Foard|2010|p=29}} contrary to the popular belief that it was fought near the foot of the hill.<ref>{{harvnb|Wainwright|2009}}; {{harvnb|Walker|2009}}.</ref>\n\n===Historians' theories===\n\nThe [[Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England]] (popularly referred to as \"English Heritage\") argues that the battle was named after Market Bosworth because the town was the nearest significant settlement to the battlefield in the 15th century.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=4}} As explored by Professor Philip Morgan, a battle might initially not be named specifically at all. As time passes, writers of administrative and historical records find it necessary to identify a notable battle, ascribing it a name that is usually [[toponymy|toponymical]] in nature and sourced from combatants or observers. This official name becomes accepted by society and future generations without question.{{sfn|Morgan|2000|p=42}}  Early records associated the Battle of Bosworth with \"Brownehethe\", \"''bellum Miravallenses''\", \"Sandeford\" and \"Dadlyngton field\".{{sfn|Morgan|2000|p=44}}  The earliest record, a municipal memorandum of 23 August 1485 from York,{{sfn|Foard|2004|p=17}} locates the battle \"on the field of Redemore\".{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|pp=1–2}}  This is corroborated by a 1485–86 letter that mentions \"Redesmore\" as its site.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=2}}  According to historian Peter Foss, records did not associate the battle with \"Bosworth\" until 1510.{{sfn|Morgan|2000|p=44}}\n\nFoss is named by English Heritage as the principal advocate for \"Redemore\" as the battle site. He suggests the name is derived from \"''Hreod Mor''\", an Anglo-Saxon phrase that means \"reedy marshland\". Basing his opinion on 13th- and 16th-century church records, he believes \"Redemore\" was an area of wetland that lay between Ambion Hill and the village of [[Dadlington]], and was close to the Fenn Lanes, a [[Roman roads|Roman road]] running east to west across the region.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=2}}  Foard believes this road to be the most probable route that both armies took to reach the battlefield.{{sfn|Foard|2004|p=51}}  Williams dismisses the notion of \"Redmore\" as a specific location, saying that the term refers to a large area of reddish soil; Foss argues that Williams's sources are local stories and flawed interpretations of records.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=3}}  Moreover, he proposes that Williams was influenced by [[William Hutton (Birmingham historian)|William Hutton]]'s 1788 ''The Battle of Bosworth-Field'', which Foss blames for introducing the notion that the battle was fought west of Ambion Hill on the north side of the [[River Sence]].{{sfn|Foss|1998|p=22}}  Hutton, as Foss suggests, misinterpreted a passage from his source, [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s 1577 ''Chronicle''. Holinshed wrote, \"King Richard pitched his field on a hill called Anne Beame, refreshed his soldiers and took his rest.\"  Foss believes that Hutton mistook \"field\" to mean \"field of battle\", thus creating the idea that the fight took place on Anne Beame (Ambion) Hill. To \"[pitch] his field\", as Foss clarifies, was a period expression for setting up a camp.{{sfn|Foss|1998|p=21}}\n\n[[File:St James the Greater, Dadlington.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Side view of a building, which has a small tower on the left side: tombstones lie in rows on plots in front.|St James the Greater, [[Dadlington]]: the dead of Bosworth Field were buried here.]]\nFoss brings further evidence for his \"Redemore\" theory by quoting [[Edward Hall]]'s 1550 ''Chronicle''. Hall stated that Richard's army stepped onto a plain after breaking camp the next day. Furthermore, historian [[William Burton (antiquary)|William Burton]], author of ''Description of Leicestershire'' (1622),{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=2}} wrote that the battle was \"fought in a large, flat, plaine, and spacious ground, three&nbsp;miles [5&nbsp;km] distant from [Bosworth], between the Towne of [[Shenton]], Sutton [Cheney], Dadlington and Stoke [Golding]\".{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=3}}  In Foss's opinion both sources are describing an area of flat ground north of Dadlington.{{sfn|Foss|1998|p=28}}\n\n===Physical site===\nEnglish Heritage, responsible for managing England's historic sites, used both theories to designate the site for Bosworth Field. Without preference for either theory, they constructed a single continuous battlefield boundary that encompasses the locations proposed by both Williams and Foss.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|pp=12–13}}  The region has experienced extensive changes over the years, starting after the battle. Holinshed stated in his chronicle that he found firm ground where he expected the marsh to be, and Burton confirmed that by the end of the 16th century, areas of the battlefield were enclosed and had been [[Land improvement|improved]] to make them agriculturally productive. Trees were planted on the south side of Ambion Hill, forming Ambion Wood. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the [[Ashby Canal]] carved through the land west and south-west of Ambion Hill. Winding alongside the canal at a distance, the [[Ashby and Nuneaton Joint Railway]] crossed the area on an embankment.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=4}}{{sfn|Gravett|1999|p=83}}  The changes to the landscape were so extensive that when Hutton revisited the region in 1807 after an earlier 1788 visit, he could not readily find his way around.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=4}}\n\n[[File:King Richard's Well.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A pyramidal stone structure stands in a small clearing surrounded by small trees and bushes.

According to legend, Richard III drank from one of the several springs in the region on the day of the battle.{{sfn|Gravett|1999|p=72}}  In 1788, a local pointed out one of the springs to Hutton as the one mentioned in the legend.{{sfn|Battlefields Trust|2004|loc=\"[http://www.battlefieldstrust.com/resource-centre/warsoftheroses/battlepageview.asp?pageid=392 Battlefield Monuments]}}  A stone structure was later built over the location.

The new site lies either side of the Fenn Lanes Roman road, close to Fenn Lane Farm and is some three kilometers to the southwest of Ambion Hill. [[File:Bosworth Battlefield (Fenn Lane Farm).jpg|thumb|Bosworth Battlefield (Fenn Lane Farm)]] \nBased on the round shot scatter, the likely size of Richard III's army, and the topography, Glenn Foard and Anne Curry think that Richard may have lined up his forces on a slight ridge which lies just east of Fox Covert Lane and behind a postulated medieval marsh.<ref>[http://www.battlefieldstrust.com/media/776.pdf Bosworth Battlefield: Conjectural terrain reconstruction with two options for the Royal army deployment], Battlefields Trust</ref><ref>[http://www.battlefieldstrust.com/media/775.pdf Deployments], Battlefields Trust</ref>  Richard's vanguard commanded by the Duke of Norfolk was on the right (north) side of Richard's battle line, with the Earl of Northumberland on Richard's left (south) side.\n\nTudor's forces approached along the line of the Roman road and lined up to the west of the present day Fenn Lane Farm, having marched from the vicinity of Merevale in Warwickshire.<ref>Peter Hammond, ''Richard III and the Bosworth Campaign'', (Barnsley, Pen and Sword, 2013) p.64</ref> \nThe Stanleys were positioned on the south side of the battlefield, on rising ground towards Stoke Golding and Dadlington. The Earl of Oxford turned north to avoid the marsh (and possibly Richard's guns). This manoeuvre put the marsh on Oxford's right. He moved to attack Norfolk's vanguard. Norfolk was subsequently killed.\n\nNorthumberland failed to engage, possibly due to the presence of the Stanleys, whose intentions were unclear, or due to the position of the marsh (or for both reasons). With his situation deteriorating, Richard decided to launch an attack against Henry Tudor, which almost succeeded, but the king's horse became stuck in the marsh, and he was killed. Fen Hole (where the boar badge was found) is believed to be a residue of the marsh. When Richard began his charge, Sir William Stanley intervened from the vicinity of Stoke Golding. It was here, on what came to be known as Crown Hill (the closest elevated ground to the fighting), that Lord Stanley crowned Henry Tudor after Richard was killed.\n\nThe windmill close to which the Duke of Norfolk is said to have died (according to the ballad \"Lady Bessy\") was Dadlington windmill. This has disappeared but is known to have stood at the time of the battle, in the vicinity of Apple Orchard Farm and North Farm, Dadlington. A small cluster of significant finds was made in this area, including a gold livery badge depicting an eagle. The windmill lay between the core battlefield and Richard's camp on Ambion Hill and the rout of Norfolk's vanguard was in this direction. This also accounts for the large number of dead in Dadlington parish, leading to the setting up of the battle chantry there.\n\nHistoric England have re-defined the boundaries of the registered Bosworth Battlefield to incorporate the newly identified site. There are hopes that public access to the site may be possible in the future.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hwa.uk.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/EB-23.pdf |title=Bosworth Battlefield: The Way Forward | date=August 2013 |accessdate=2016-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818145049/http://www.hwa.uk.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/EB-23.pdf |archivedate=18 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|24em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n'''Books'''\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Adams |first=Michael |title=Echoes of War: a Thousand Years of Military History in Popular Culture |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dDqWvwezm0YC |year=2002 |publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]] |location=Kentucky, United States |isbn=0-8131-2240-6 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Baker |first=John |authorlink=John Baker (legal historian) |title=The Oxford History of the Laws of England 1483–1558 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Xc5qqYoF22IC |series=The Oxford History of the Laws of England |volume=VI |year=2003 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-825817-8 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Britnell |first=Richard |title=The Closing of the Middle Ages?: England, 1471–1529 |year=1997 |publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |location=Oxford |isbn=0-631-16598-3 |chapter=Country Politics |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Burrow |first=Colin |editor-last=Kinney |editor-first=Arthur |title=The Cambridge Companion to English Literature, 1500–1600 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nkJad0EYVxIC |year=2000 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-58758-1 |chapter=The Sixteenth Century |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=nkJad0EYVxIC&pg=PA11 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Carpenter |first=Christine |title=The Wars of the Roses: Politics and the Constitution in England, c. 1437–1509 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=z0A9frbkU0MC |series=Cambridge Medieval Textbooks |year=2002 |origyear=1997 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-521-31874-2 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Chrimes |first=Stanley |title=Henry VII |url=https://books.google.com/?id=MQlo014s8lkC |series=Yale English Monarchs |origyear=1972 |year=1999 |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |location=[[New Haven, Connecticut]];
